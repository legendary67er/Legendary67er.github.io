  <h2>Exhibit Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Early civilizations didn’t grow just because people learned farming or built cities — they grew because they learned
    how to <em>organize humans</em>. Once communities became large, they needed leadership, rules, shared beliefs, and
    systems for deciding labor and rewards. Social hierarchies and governments emerged to solve real problems:
    defending land, storing food, settling disputes, and coordinating huge building projects.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The five artifacts in this exhibit come from five different cultures studied in early world history:
    <strong>Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, and Greece</strong>. Each item reveals a piece of how power was created,
    justified, and displayed — sometimes through law, sometimes religion, and sometimes public participation.

      <p>
        The Code of Hammurabi is one of the earliest known written law codes, carved into a tall stone stele for the public
        to see. At the top, King Hammurabi stands before Shamash, the god of justice, showing that Babylonian government
        claimed divine approval. This artifact reveals a society built on strict hierarchy. The laws give different
        punishments depending on social class — nobles, commoners, and enslaved people were treated unequally. For example,
        harming a noble could bring harsher penalties than harming a commoner. That shows that law was not purely about
        fairness; it was about maintaining social order and protecting elite power.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The stele also shows why governments formed: big cities needed clear rules for trade, property, family roles, and
        violence. By writing laws down, Babylon created consistency and authority across a large empire. The Code of Hammurabi
        is important because it proves early states used law to organize people, reinforce class structure, and legitimize rule.

      <p>
        The Narmer Palette is a ceremonial object that celebrates the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under King Narmer.
        It is packed with symbolic imagery showing how Egyptian government and hierarchy worked. Narmer appears larger than
        everyone else, a classic artistic sign of supreme authority. He wears the crowns of both regions, holding a weapon over
        a defeated enemy, while loyal attendants stand nearby. This design suggests Egypt saw the pharaoh not just as a political
        leader but as a semi-divine force who brought order (ma’at) to chaos.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The palette communicates that hierarchy was natural and necessary: the pharaoh controls violence and protects the land,
        priests and officials support him, and lower classes serve in farming and labor. This artifact also hints at why strong
        centralized rule mattered in Egypt — controlling the Nile floods, organizing irrigation, and running huge building projects
        required a leader with unquestioned power. The Narmer Palette thus shows how early civilizations used art to display and
        justify authority, making the social pyramid feel permanent and sacred.

  <h2>Artifact 3: Ashoka’s Pillar Edicts <span class="tag">India (Mauryan Empire)</span></h2>

    <div class="content">
      <div class="meta">c. 3rd century BCE • Stone pillars with inscriptions</div>
      <p>
        Ashoka’s Pillar Edicts are stone columns placed across the Mauryan Empire, each carved with messages from Emperor Ashoka.
        After witnessing the destruction of war, Ashoka converted to Buddhism and used government to promote moral behavior.
        The edicts instruct citizens to show compassion, tolerate different religions, respect parents and teachers, and avoid cruelty.
        This reflects a government trying to unify a diverse empire through shared ethical values instead of constant violence.  
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the pillars show hierarchy in a subtle way. Only a powerful centralized ruler could spread identical
        messages across thousands of miles, in multiple languages, and expect people to follow them. By placing edicts in public
        spaces, Ashoka used written authority to guide daily life. This artifact reveals a shift in early governments:
        power was still top-down, but rulers increasingly claimed legitimacy through moral duty and public welfare. The pillars
        prove that states weren’t only about controlling people — they also shaped culture and identity through ideas.

      <p>
        The Terracotta Army consists of thousands of life-size soldiers buried with China’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.
        Each figure has unique facial features and detailed armor, showing the massive resources and labor controlled by the Qin state.
        This artifact reflects extremely strong hierarchy. The emperor sat at the absolute top of society, followed by nobles,
        military leaders, farmers, artisans, and at the bottom, enslaved workers who likely helped build the tomb.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The army also demonstrates how government relied on military power to unify and control territory. Qin Shi Huang
        standardized writing, currency, and laws, but he enforced obedience through strict Legalist policies and intimidation.
        A monument this huge sends a clear message: imperial authority lasted beyond death. The Terracotta Army is important to
        understanding early civilization because it shows that many governments justified hierarchy with force, organization, and
        the belief that rulers were larger-than-life figures essential to national stability.

    <div class="content">
      <div class="meta">5th century BCE • Public meeting space & voting shards</div>
      <p>
        The Athenian Agora was the heart of democratic life in Athens. Citizens gathered there to debate laws, vote, do business,
        and discuss philosophy. Unlike the earlier empires in this exhibit, Athens experimented with distributing power among
        citizens through assemblies and councils. Ostraka — clay pottery shards used for ostracism votes — are a key related artifact.
        Citizens scratched names onto these shards to vote a person out of the city if they seemed dangerous to democracy.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, the Agora shows democracy existed alongside hierarchy. Only free adult male citizens could participate; women,
        foreigners, and enslaved people were excluded. So the artifact reveals a complicated system: government was more shared,
        but social status still controlled who counted as “the people.” The Agora and ostraka demonstrate that early civilizations
        could organize power in multiple ways, including participatory systems, yet social inequality remained a common feature.
        Athens proves hierarchy wasn’t always based on kings — sometimes it was based on citizenship itself.

  <h2>Synthesis Essay: What These Artifacts Reveal About Power and Society</h2>
  <div class="essay">
    <p>
      Across early history, civilizations expanded when humans developed ways to manage large communities. The artifacts in this
      exhibit show that social hierarchies and governments were not accidental — they were tools that helped societies survive,
      grow, and control resources. While each culture created different systems, the basic problem was the same: once humans lived
      in cities, they needed leadership, rules, and shared ideas to prevent chaos. The Code of Hammurabi, Narmer Palette, Ashoka’s
      Pillars, Terracotta Army, and the Athenian Agora reveal both the variety and the similarity of how power worked in the ancient world.
    </p>

    <p>
      One clear conclusion is that early governments often used <strong>religion and symbolism to justify hierarchy</strong>.
      The Narmer Palette presents the pharaoh as a divinely supported unifier who brings order to Egypt. The scenes are not neutral
      records of history — they are propaganda. By portraying Narmer as larger than others and chosen by the gods, Egyptian society
      encouraged obedience and unity. Similarly, Hammurabi’s stele shows the king receiving authority from Shamash. The message is
      that law is not merely the king’s opinion; it is holy and universal. In both cases, religion strengthens government by making
      power feel natural and unquestionable.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second conclusion is that <strong>law and bureaucracy developed to manage complex societies</strong>.
      Hammurabi’s Code outlines punishments, property rules, family expectations, and economic policies. The fact that laws were written
      meant they could be standardized across a wide territory. Written rules also helped elites maintain their position because the
      punishments depended on class. Ashoka’s Pillars show another stage of bureaucracy: a ruler communicating values across an empire.
      The pillars were essentially public announcements carved in stone, and they reveal a government that used writing to shape behavior
      on a huge scale. Together these artifacts prove that government grew stronger when it gained control over knowledge and communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      Third, the artifacts show that <strong>military organization was tightly connected to hierarchy</strong>.
      The Terracotta Army is a physical expression of the Qin empire’s extreme centralization. Qin Shi Huang’s rule depended on a
      powerful army and strict obedience to law. The scale of the tomb proves that the emperor could command thousands of workers and
      funnel enormous wealth into one project — a sign of a very steep social pyramid. The Narmer Palette also links power to military victory.
      In these civilizations, the right to rule was often tied to the ability to conquer and control violence. Governments protected people
      from enemies, but they also kept citizens in line by force.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the Athenian Agora complicates the picture. Athens shows that early governments did not always concentrate power in one divine ruler.
      Instead, many citizens participated directly in lawmaking. Ostraka show a system where ordinary citizens had a formal method to prevent tyranny.
      Yet Athens also reveals how even democracies had boundaries. Participation depended on being a male citizen, and that citizenship itself was
      a privileged status supported by the labor of women, foreigners, and enslaved people. So Athens demonstrates that hierarchy changes form, but
      rarely disappears. Where Babylon elevated nobles, and China elevated the emperor, Athens elevated citizens over non-citizens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking across all five artifacts, the most important pattern is this:
      <strong>social hierarchies were universal because they solved real problems, but they also created lasting inequality</strong>.
      Civilizations needed leaders to coordinate farming, trade, defense, and construction. Hierarchies made that coordination possible by giving
      certain people authority. At the same time, those structures hardened into class systems that benefited elites. Hammurabi’s Code protected order,
      but it openly valued nobles more than commoners. Egypt’s pharaohs organized society into a stable, efficient system, but one that kept the majority
      as laborers. China unified through standardization and control, yet that control demanded submission. India under Ashoka promoted peace and morality, 
      but only because an emperor had enough power to spread those values. Athens expanded political voice, but limited that voice to a select group.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, these artifacts show that early civilizations were experiments in organizing humans at scale. Their governments and hierarchies looked
      different — theocratic monarchy, legal empire, moral kingship, militarized autocracy, and democracy — but all were designed to answer the same
      question: “How do we live together in large numbers?” The ancient world’s answers shaped the foundations of modern society. Even today, governments
      use law, public monuments, moral messaging, and civic participation to maintain order. The artifacts in this exhibit prove that power has always
      been constructed through a combination of ideas and institutions — and that understanding those early systems helps explain the world we live in now.
