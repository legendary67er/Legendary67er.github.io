  <h2>Exhibit Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This exhibit shows five military artifacts from ancient civilizations.
    Each object demonstrates how early societies used weapons, armor,
    and technology to protect themselves, conquer enemies, and display power.

      <p>
        The Assyrian battering ram was one of the most important siege weapons in the ancient world because it helped armies defeat strong city walls. Most big ancient cities protected themselves with thick mud-brick walls and heavy wooden gates, so a normal attack could fail for weeks or months. The Assyrians solved this by building a wheeled ram with a strong wooden beam (often tipped with metal) that could repeatedly smash into a wall or gate until it broke. Many rams were covered with a wooden roof and protective sides so soldiers inside could push it forward without being hit by rocks, arrows, or spears. Archers and shield-bearers often supported the ram by firing at defenders on top of the wall. This weapon shows how Assyria combined engineering and teamwork to expand its empire, and how military technology could decide the outcome of war.

  <h2>Hittite War Chariot <span class="tag">Anatolia</span></h2>

      <div class="meta">Hittite Empire • Chariot Warfare</div>
      <p>
        The Hittite war chariot was a fast and powerful battlefield weapon used during the Bronze Age, especially when open land allowed speed and movement. Unlike some earlier chariots that carried only two people, many Hittite chariots are described as carrying a crew of three: a driver to control the horses, a warrior to fight with a spear or other weapon, and another soldier who could protect the crew or use a bow. This extra crew made the chariot more stable in combat and helped it hit enemy lines harder. Chariots were expensive and required skilled workers to build wheels, axles, and frames, so they also represented wealth and organization in the Hittite Empire. In war, chariots could rush in to break formations, chase fleeing troops, or quickly move leaders across the battlefield. This artifact shows how early armies used speed, training, and technology to gain an advantage.

  <h2>Spartan Helmet <span class="tag">Greece</span></h2>

      <div class="meta">Sparta • Hoplite Armor</div>
      <p>
        The Spartan helmet is a famous symbol of Greek hoplite warfare and the strict military culture of Sparta. Made from bronze, this style of helmet covered most of the head and face, leaving only narrow openings for the eyes and mouth. That design gave excellent protection against arrows, spear points, and sword strikes, but it also limited hearing and side vision, which meant soldiers needed formation training to fight effectively. Spartans were known for fighting as hoplites in a phalanx, where each soldier’s shield protected the man beside him. The helmet supports that style because it was built for close combat, where soldiers stayed in tight ranks instead of running individually. Helmets also helped create unity: when a whole line of warriors wore the same intimidating armor, it made the army look stronger and more confident. This artifact shows how Greek military success depended on teamwork, training, and bravery under pressure.

  <h2>Terracotta Army Soldier <span class="tag">China</span></h2>

      <div class="meta">Qin Dynasty • Imperial Army</div>
      <p>
        A Terracotta Army soldier represents the military power and strict organization of China under the Qin Dynasty. Around 210 BCE, the first emperor of a unified China, Qin Shi Huang, ordered thousands of life-size clay soldiers, horses, and weapons to be built and buried near his tomb. Each figure was made with detailed armor, hairstyles, and facial features, creating the impression of a real army prepared for battle. The purpose was to protect the emperor in the afterlife, but the project also sends a strong message about power in the real world. Creating this army required huge resources, skilled artisans, and a government that could command labor on a massive scale. The Terracotta Army reflects how Qin leadership relied on military strength, discipline, and standardization to control a large empire. Even though these soldiers were made of clay, they represent real troops who fought for Qin expansion. This artifact shows how governments used the military to build authority and how rulers used symbols to prove their dominance.

  <h2>Egyptian Khopesh Sword <span class="tag">Egypt</span></h2>

    <div class="content">
      <div class="meta">New Kingdom Egypt • Curved Sword</div>
      <p>
        The Egyptian khopesh was a famous weapon that combined the cutting power of a sword with the shape of a hooked blade. It is often linked to Egypt’s New Kingdom period, when pharaohs led armies in major campaigns and Egypt became an expanding empire. The khopesh’s curved design made it useful in close combat because it could slash like an axe and also hook around a shield or weapon. A soldier might use the curve to pull an enemy off balance, create an opening, or knock a shield aside so another warrior could strike. Khopesh swords were not only practical weapons; they were also symbols of royal power. Pharaohs are sometimes shown in art holding a khopesh to show strength and victory, even when the image is ceremonial rather than a real battle scene. Because it was a recognizable and respected weapon, the khopesh represented both military technology and the authority of Egypt’s leaders. This artifact shows how weapons could be tools of war and symbols of government power at the same time.
